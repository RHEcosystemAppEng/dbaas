= Connecting an application to a database instance using the topology view

[role="_abstract"]
You can add a database to an application by making a connection to the database instance from the cloud-database provider.
On the **Topology** page, you see the application pod, along with a representation of the connection of the database instance.

////
.Prerequisites

* An instance of OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.9 or higher running on Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated (OSD) or Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA).
** When using OSD or ROSA, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and credentials are required.
* Access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) console.
* Creation of a provider account instance for the cloud database provider.
////

.Procedure

. When hovering the cursor over the deployment node, you can drag the arrow from the application to the new database instance to create a binding connector.
You can also right-click on the deployment node, and click **Create Service Binding** to create a binding connector.

. On the pop-up dialog, click **Create**.
Once the binding is created, the application pod restarts.
After the application pod restarts, your application now has database connectivity.

This binding visually represents the injection of database connection information and credentials into the application pod.

. Use a service binding library based on your application's framework to consume the service binding information and credentials.
