[IMPORTANT]
====
The OpenShift Database Access is a Service Preview release operator that enables:

* Easy consumption of database-as-a-service (DBaaS) offerings from partners including MongoDB Atlas, Crunchy Bridge, CockroachDB, and Amazon's Relational Database Services (RDS) directly from managed OpenShift clusters.
* Easy management, monitoring, and control by administrators of cloud-hosted DBaaS including consumption, usage, and status.

OpenShift Database Access (OpenShift Database Access) is a Service Preview release.
A Service Preview release has features that are early in development.
Service Preview releases are not production ready and might have features and functionality that are not fully tested.
We advises you not to use OpenShift Database Access for production or business-critical workloads.

== Installing OpenShift Database Access using the Operator Lifecycle Manager

For some OpenShift cluster types, such as Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), you must install the OpenShift Database Access operator by using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

.Prerequisites

* OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 or higher.
* A running OpenShift Dedicated or ARO cluster.

.Procedure

. Log into OpenShift by using the a command-line interface:
+
.Syntax
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
oc login --token=_TOKEN_ --server=_SERVER_URL_AND_PORT_
----
+
.Example
----
$ oc login --token=sha256~ZvFDBvoIYAbVECixS4-WmkN4RfnNd8Neh3y1WuiFPXC --server=https://example.com:6443
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can find your command-line login token and URL from the OpenShift console.
Log in to the OpenShift console.
Click your user name, and click **Copy login command**.
Offer your user name and password again, and click **Display Token** to view the command.
====

. Create an OpenShift Database Access catalog source using the latest add-on image repository:
+
.Example
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: dbaas-operator
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  image: quay.io/osd-addons/dbaas-operator-index@sha256:2788a47fd0ef1ece30898c1e608050ea71036d3329b9772dbb3d1f69313f745c
  displayName: DBaaS Operator
EOF
----

. Verify the catalog source is added, and in a ready state:
+
.Example
----
$ oc get catalogsource dbaas-operator \
-n openshift-marketplace \
-o jsonpath='{.status.connectionState.lastObservedState} {"\n"}'
----
+
IMPORTANT: Wait until the catalog source is in a `READY` state, before proceeding to the next step.

. Login to the OpenShift console with a user that has administrative privileges.

. In the **Administrator** perspective, expand the **Operators** navigation menu, and click **OperatorHub**.

. In the filter field, type **database access**, and click the **OpenShift Database Access Operator** tile.

. Click the **Install** button to show the operator details.

. The default and recommended namespace for the OpenShift Database Access operator is **openshift-dbaas-operator**, click **Install** on the **Install Operator** page.
+
NOTE: All dependencies are automatically installed, this includes the provider account operators, and the quick-start guides.

.Verification

. Once the OpenShift Database Access operator successfully installs, a new navigation menu item is added, called **Data Services**.
Expand the **Data Services** menu.
This might take a few minutes to refresh the navigation menu.

. Click **Database Access**.

[id="accessing-the-database-access-menu-for-configuring-and-monitoring"]

== Accessing the Database Access menu for configuring and monitoring

From the OpenShift console, you can access the OpenShift Database Access navigation menu.
On the Database Access page, use the appropriate project namespace for importing a cloud-database provider account.

[IMPORTANT]
====
By using MongoDB Atlas as a cloud-database provider, you must add the IP address of the application pod to MongoDB Atlas' **IP Access List**.
If the IP address is not in the **IP Access List**, then a `504 gateway timeout error` occurs.
Visit the MongoDB Atlas link:https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security/ip-access-list/[website] for more details on adding an IP address to your database project.
====

[NOTE]
====
After creating a _DBaaSPolicy_ as a non-administrative user, on the *Operator details* page, under the *Provider Account Policy* section, you will see a restricted access message.
By selecting *Current namespace only* option, you can view the policies.

[id="connecting-an-application-to-a-database-instance-using-the-topology-view"]

== Connecting an application to a database instance using the topology view

You can add a database to an application by making a connection to the database instance from the cloud-database provider.
On the **Topology** page, you see the application pod, along with a representation of the connection of the database instance.

.Prerequisites

* xref:installing-openshift-database-access-using-the-operator-lifecycle-manager[Installation] of the OpenShift Database Access operator.
* Import at least one cloud-database provider account.

.Procedure

. When hovering the cursor over the deployment node, you can drag the arrow from the application to the new database instance to create a binding connector.
You can also right-click on the deployment node, and click **Create Service Binding** to create a binding connector.
+
image::../images/dbaas_create_binding_connector_between_app_and_db.png[The topology view of the application and the database with a dotted line arrow indicating database binding in the process of being dragged from the database to the application]

. On the pop-up dialog, click **Create**.
Once the binding is created, the application pod restarts.
After the application pod restarts, your application now has database connectivity.
+
image::../images/dbaas_binding_between_app_and_db.png[The topology view of the application and the database with a solid line arrow indicating database binding to the application is complete]
+
This binding visually represents the injection of database connection information and credentials into the application pod.

. Use a service binding library based on your application's framework to consume the service binding information and credentials.

.Additional Resources

* See the OpenShift Database Access _Reference Guide_ for more details on service bindings, and for working application examples by using the service binding libraries.
